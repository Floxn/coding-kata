# Instructions #

Imagine a bookstore that is selling the seven books from the Harry Potter series. Each book has a standard price of $8.00. 
However, if you buy more than one of the series at a time, you get a discount. Buying multiple copies of the same book title does not earn a discount.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Number of Different Book Titles</th>
<th>Discount Percentage</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>5%</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>10%</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>15%</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>25%</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>30%</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>35%</td></tr>
