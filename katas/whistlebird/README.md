In a hectic office building, high above the city's skyscrapers, the CEO of the company "TechGenius Solutions" was suddenly seized by a fit of megalomania. With flashing eyes, he announced: "We're going to outdo Twitter and knock it off its throne! We need a new social network - and we need it now!"

You are a software developer who has been working in the background until now and are suddenly thrust into the limelight. "You are our genius! Build us a revolutionary social media network and do it yesterday!" announced the CEO with a grin that sounded more like self-promotion than reason.

You sigh, stand in front of his cluttered computer and start typing code with your fingers flying. The countdown to the presentation to investors had begun, and you had your hands full turning the megalomaniac's vision into reality.
