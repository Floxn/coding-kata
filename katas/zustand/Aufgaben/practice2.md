# TODO List with Zustand
Now that we've build a small store in Zustand, let's make a Todo List store, where the state is available everywhere we need it.

1. Create a Todo store in src/store/todoStore.ts
2. Update the TodoList.tsx component with the add, delete, complete function, as well as the array of Todos
3. Test your component locally with `npm start`
